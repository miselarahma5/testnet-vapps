## Problem Statement
Many community members want to participate in decentralized finance but do not have access to complex tools or large capital. There is a need for a simple, fun, and transparent way to save tokens together and receive periodic rewards.

---

## Proposed Solution
We propose a Community Savings Pool where users deposit small amounts of tokens into a shared pool. Every week, one or more winners are randomly selected to receive bonus rewards. The system ensures fairness and transparency using Soundness Layer integration.

---

## Key Features
- Micro-savings: Users can contribute small token amounts.  
- Fair Randomization: Winners are chosen with cryptographic fairness proof.  
- Community Engagement: Encourages consistent participation.  
- Soundness Layer Integration: Provides verifiable randomness and auditability.  

---

## Architecture Overview
1. Smart contract for deposits, withdrawals, and weekly draws.  
2. Randomness verification powered by Soundness Layer.  
3. Simple front-end dashboard for tracking deposits and winners.  

---

## Development Timeline
- Week 1: Smart contract design and pool logic.  
- Week 2: Integration with Soundness Layer randomness.  
- Week 3: Front-end UI/UX development.  
- Week 4: Testing and community feedback.

## Expected Outcome
A fun and simple DeFi application that introduces the community to decentralized savings, while showcasing the power of the Soundness Layer in ensuring fairness and transparency.
